# algorithms
Some awesome algorithms written in JavaScript!

##Description
A collection of basic and advanced data structures and algorithms based on Thomas Cormen's book on Algorithm and loosely based on Stanford's CS106B course - all written in JavaScript. Also included are some functional programming based on the underscore.js library
